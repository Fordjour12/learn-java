# Data Types

Types of datatype:

- Boolean: (false | true)
- Integer:

  - byte:
    this holds only 8-bit(1 byte). hold value -128 to 127
    used to save memory.
  - short:
    this holds only 16-bit(2 byte). holds value from -32768 t0 32767
  - int:
    this hold only 32-bit(4 byte). holds value from
  - long:
    this hold only 64-bit(8 byte). holds -2^63 to 2^63 -1. it is denoted by "L" or "l"

- float:
  it is a 32-bit single precision floating. not ideal for items like money. it is denoted by "f" or "F"

- double: it is a 64-bit double precision floating point. not ideal for currency. better for scientific calculations.

- char: it is a 16-bit unicode character. The minimum value of the char data type is '\u0000' (0) and the maximum value of the is '\uffff'.
